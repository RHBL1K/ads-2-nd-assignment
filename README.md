This code repository was created for completing Assignment 2 on Algorithm and Data Structures using Java. It includes implementations of MyArrayList and MyLinkedList classes, which mimic ArrayList and LinkedList functionalities.

Furthermore, it includes implementations of MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap classes, which are based on MyArrayList and MyLinkedList. These implementations focus on selecting the best-suited physical data structures for each logical data structure separately.
